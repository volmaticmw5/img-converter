# Convert images in bulk to desired formats
Convert tga, png and webp files to any of the mentioned formats.
Couldn't find anything that would work cross platform to do this, so here you go!

## Basic usage
#### Convert every file in source directory, including sub directories and put them into output_dir with desired format
```python img_converter.py <source_dir> <source_format> <output_dir> <output_format>```

#### Example
```python img_converter.py source_dir tga output_dir webp```
